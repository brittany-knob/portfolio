This is a sample of various coding projects I've worked on.<br>
1. Assignment2.py is a Python code written to traverse through a list, eliminate any repeated integers, and averge the remaining elements. 
2. Teropods.py is Pyhton code that models the data on theropod size, and plots with a logarithmic step.
3. finalproject.m calculates the stress and strain of muscle using root finding methods in C++.
4. hatp36b_plot (1).ipynb plots the relative flux of star brightness during an exoplanet transit in Python. 
5. least squares.ccp is another root finding method in C++.
6. trainingmgnet.py is a python machine learning smaple that trains mgnet with cifar10.
